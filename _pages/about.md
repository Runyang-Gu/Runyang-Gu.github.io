<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a philosophy undergrad at Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof. Davide Fassio. I love to research on issues at the intersection of epistemology, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language and ethics. Topics that interest me are emotions, imagination, self-knowledge, bounded rationality, and practical encroachment. I also love to read things about photography and psychoanalysis.
